Every business aims to boost sales and profitability. To achieve this, they want to ensure that their current consumers stick around for a long time in addition to bringing in new ones. Additionally, it's crucial from a strategic standpoint to know in advance whether a certain group of clients intends to discontinue utilising their services (especially recurring ones like internet, cable, phone etc.). Each organisation or corporation does this by developing and monitoring customer metrics, which are then used to calculate the chance of churn.

Customer When a consumer decides to cease using a firm's services, that company experiences churn. In order to forecast the likelihood that each client will leave, I used the customer data from a US-based telecom firm. I've chosen the data from telecom companies because customer turnover is a key issue for businesses in that industry.

The result of the churn model can also be utilised as a signal that some customers are probably going to churn. Customers can be effectively retained by addressing the major factors that are increasing their likelihood to churn.
